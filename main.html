	<h1>Why I want to become a developer? </h1>
	<p>  I want to become a developer because I enjoy solving problems, building new things, 
  and learning how technology can make life easier. Developing software allows me to 
  be creative, think logically, and constantly improve my skills while working on projects 
  that can have a real impact. </p>
